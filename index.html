<h2>PONNIYIN SELVAN INTRODUCTION</h2>
</left>
<p><i>Ponniyin Selvan is a Tamil language historical fiction novel by Indian author<b> Kalki Krishnamurthy</b>. It was first serialised in the weekly editions of Kalki, a Tamil magazine, from 29 October 1950 to 16 May 1954 and later integrated into<b> five volumes in 1955</b> .This story revolves around Vandiyathevan, a charming, brave and courageous young man who sets out across the Chola land to deliver a message from the Crown Prince, Aditya Karikalan, to Emperor Sundara Chola and Princess Kundavai. The story shuttles between Vandiyathevan's travels in Chola country and the young Prince Arulmozhivarman's (later known as Raja Raja Chola) travels in Sri Lanka. The narrative details attempts by his sister Kundavai to bring back Arulmozhivarman to establish political peace in a land seemingly beset with unrest and civil war plotted by vassals and petty chieftains. The story begins as the emperor Sundara Chola is ill and bedridden. His son Aditya Karikalan is the general of the Northern Command and lives in Kanchi. The younger son Arulmozhivarman is in Sri Lanka on a military campaign. Their sister Kundavai lives in the Chola royal household at Pazhayarai. The story advances when rumours abound that there is a conspiracy against Sundara Chola and his sons.</i></p>

<h4>OVERVIEW FOR THE 5 PARTS OF PONNIYIN SELVAN STORY</h4>

<p><i>The Story starts with <b>Aaditha Karikalan</b>, elder brother of Arunmozhi Varman sends two messages to his father Sundhara Chola and younger sister Kundavai through Vaanar clan prince Vandhiyadevan. Ponniyin Selvan: I tells the story how Vandhiyadevan saves Aaditha Karikalan, Arunmozhi Varman and their father Sundhara Chola from Pandya Aabath udhavigal. With hurdles and twists, Is Vandhiyadevan successful in saving all three people belonging to the Royal family? It is through Vandiyacevan that we meet most of the characters in the novel such as Arulmozhi Varman, the prince whom all the people loved, and Periya Pazhavetturayar, the chancellor who married Nandhini (the main conspirator), when he was sixty. During his youth, Aditya Karikalan had fallen in love with Nandhini, but she turned vengeful after Aditya Karikalan killed Veerapandiyan (who was probably her lover. It was a confusion which revolves in the story, some says it was her father.) and vowed to destroy the Chola dynasty. We also meet Kundavai Devi, who after hearing the news of the conspiracy sends Vandiyadevan to Sri Lanka to give a message to Arulmozhi Varman to come back immediately.
